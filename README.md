# DualPaneLayout

Android devices come in all shapes and sizes, so your app's layout needs to be flexible. 
That is, instead of defining your layout with rigid dimensions that assume a certain screen size and aspect ratio,
your layout should gracefully respond to different screen sizes and orientations.
